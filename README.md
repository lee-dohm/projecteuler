# Project Euler in Ruby

This is my attempt to learn more about [Ruby](http://www.rubylang.org) by going through as many [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net) problems as I can stomach.  I intend to document solutions along the way with benchmarks to further my understanding of the in's and out's of the language.

## Problem Descriptions

* [Problem 1](Problem1.md)
* [Problem 2](Problem2.md)
* [Problem 3](Problem3.md)
